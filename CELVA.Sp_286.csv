My mother found a the number of an old friend of my father and told me to call him. I did and he told me about the pharmacy, why it's still a good choice to get there, and why i should work to get there. From this day, my life had a new goal, work to become a pharmacist.I guess that call made me the pharmacist student i am today. So it's actually changed my life ain a better way. I could have been a dentist or i could have something really different. May be a commercial or an english teacher. I'm really proud of what i've done untill now and i hope i can be rightful of what i'll do in the years to come."",17011631,13,French,Pharmacie,Oui,2,0,2,8,Oui,1997,M1,21,Anglais,B1,quotidienne,M,""lundi 8 octobre 2018, 15:32"",""lundi 8 octobre 2018, 15:50""";"14006121,""Modern medical bacteriology has been evolving a lot lately. Even if the most striking invention in the field is the discovery of antibiotics, the bacteria analysis still didn't change since the 70's. However, in the last decade, we could developp new genome-based techniques. In order to simplify the diagnosis and the analysis of bacterial resistance and pathogenesis mechanisms, researchers and pharmaceutical companies from all over the world have spent their time, money and a lot of dedication to these new techniques. Following an example (ISG15 &amp";" <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>), this short article will present you the guidelines to follow in order to create a technique of this kind.At first, you must ensure that the pathology that you want to study is related to a single and specific pathogen (bacteria, ...). Then, an harassing work of molecular mechanisms elucidation needs to be done in order to understand : how, when and why the pathology appears, as well as how can we detect it and how can we treat/cure it. If we already have medicines which may target this microbe, then we may have to use it. Else we have to create a new molecule to fight against the pathogen using the different molecular mechanisms we previously discovered.The example I took is an human, innate imunnity-related protein called ISG15 during genital infections due to <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>. This protein was thought to have little impact on this bacteria but it has been recently established that it could be an indicator of vaginal chlamydiosis. Actually, this intracellular protein is found in the infected cells at an early stage of infection and in the blood at a later stage. The plasmatic levels of ISG15 could help the diagnosis. The upregulation of this protein may be related to a better recovery of the infection in mice -even if it can't be the only way to cure it.In conclusion, my personal opinion on the discovery of the importance of ISG15 in <i>Chlamydia</i>-related infections stands in 2 points. Once again, it shows that we can still developp and create anti-infective agents. It is also a quite beautiful proof that modern bacteriology needs to go further and further in the detail when trying to discover a new drug."",14006121,10,French,Pharmacie,Oui,14,3,10,5,Non,1996,M2,22,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,M,""lundi 8 octobre 2018, 15:54"",""lundi 8 octobre 2018, 15:54""""15000083,""My first intership : During the first year of pharmacy, we have to do a mandatory intership in a pharmacy.Mine was very intersting. It lasted 6 weeks and i learned a lot. I applied in a pharmacy next to my house in order to lower the travel duration. The owner of the pharmacy was very happy about the idea of getting a student and the other pharmacists were very friendly. One of them especially teached me everything. He was a former student in our university so we talked about the teachers he had and his job in the """"corpo"""" (our student organisation). This pharmacist explained to me the fonctionning of the pharmacy, from the backward (how to store de drugs, to control everything etc..) to the counter (give the patients some tips, figure out what is wrong, help the patients etc..).I prepared some medications for old people who couldn't come to the pharmacy anymore and brought it to them and helped them in many ways, as far as i could.This first exerience in a pharmacy was very intersting and i'm very happy about it.This intership was very intersting, it helped me a lot for my studies because i learned about many illness and medication."",15000083,11,French,Pharmacie,Oui,4,1,3,30,Oui,22,M1,22,Anglais,B2,quotidienne,M,""lundi 8 octobre 2018, 15:55"",""lundi 8 octobre 2018, 15:55""";"15007237,""My 3rd year internship :I had to do 1 full week in a community pharmacy during my 3rd year. I also had to make a report about the dyslipidemias and how to treat them in a community pharmacy.I did this intership in a little community pharmacy in the city center of Dinan with just one pharmacist. It was interresting but a bit long and i had some exams to work on for the week after so i talked to my pharmacist about it and she said that if i finished my report before friday i could go home earlier. So i spent the majority of my time working on that report and I didn't even go and speak with some patients because I was a bit in a hurry. The subject of the report was interresting but not that much because we had to go really deep in the subject and so it was a bit difficult and long. For example we had to comment a lot of prescriptions with all the details about every drug : Initial indication, mecanism of action, side effects, adn everything else. We also had to do like a therapeutical paper for the patients about one subject of our choice (still in dyslipidemias) so i did one about the risks of eating too much (especially about how it is impacting on the vessals, the bloodstream and the risks) fat and how to change that, how to eat better, which products they have to avoid and which ones they have to prefer. At the end of the week we had to make a presentation at the pharmacist about a subject of our choice. So i did it about how the lipids can bloke the blood in the vessals and how this formation can """"explode"""" and relieve some toxins, proteins adn other bad things int hte blood stream or even destroy the vessal. Obviously this ends really bad. So i also had to give some solutions about the way of live because that is how people can reduce the risk : Better food, exercise ... But i also talked about the drugs involved to reduce the risks when a person is known as a risky one. It hink this internship is a good idea at first but finally not that much when some exams are planned juste after because we just want to end it up quickly to be able to work on our exams. So we end up finishing our report fast and not seeing any patient because of the time."",15007237,11,French,Pharmacie,Oui,40,10,30,30,Oui,1996,M1,22,Anglais,C1,quotidienne,M,""lundi 8 octobre 2018, 15:57"",""lundi 8 octobre 2018, 15:57""";
